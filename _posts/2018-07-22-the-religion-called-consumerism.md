title: The religion called Consumerism
---

The world is a harsh place. There's no room to care about anyone who doesn't think in terms of bringing value to the world and instead thinks about bringing value to their own self. No one in the world will remember you if you don't bring something new to the table.

## Be a creator

> *A consumer is someone who is subject to the ideas and business models of creators.*

If you want to become someone the world remembers, the only way to do it is to become a creator. ***Anyone who adds value to society is a creator.***

## Have bigger and better goals

Gaming, social media or anything of the sort are specifically made to trigger Dopamine in our bodies. That's why it feels so good to hear that notification sound or get your latest post liked. However, we're social animals. Dopamine was meant to be realeased only when we formed deep, meaningful human relationships, as a way to make us keep going.

### What happens today

These days, when it's become so easy to get it, we don't work hard or put in the effort for it. That's where having bigger and better goals help. It releases Dopamine only when we really deserve it. It keeps us from getting used to it and going into depression or having withdrawal symptoms.

## How consumers turn into creators

Anyone can become a creator. It doesn't even have to involve knowing something already. If you want to learn, anything is possible. In my opinion learning things when you actually need them is far better than learning everything and using that knowledge afterwards.

## Solve problems

If you can manage to learn things as and when you actually need them, you can become a problem solver. You can become someone that people can depend on. Someone who can figure out how to do something even if they have no clue what they're doing in the start.

In short, if you want to contribute to the good of the world and everything that's in it, ***become a creator.***
