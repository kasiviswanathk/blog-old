title: Don't be different
---

Being the same is okay, but make sure you know who to copy. Don't blatantly copy everyone else who know nothing better than you do yourself.

There's nothing more important to doing something new than believing in what you're doing. If you can manage that, then what you've done is already put yourself into an extremely small minority. You've added value to the world.

## What's next?

You have to have a monopolist idea, and yet not bring attention to yourself. To do this, you need to understand the fundamental difference between monopolies and non-monopolies.

> Any company that says "we're different because we do X" out loud is ***not*** a monopoly.

Take Google for instance. Their core competency is search. Yet if you ask them what their business is exactly, they'll say they're a 'technology company', making their market seem extremely broad and full of competition. This actually isn't the case. Google has dominated the search industry for years with no plans of stepping down anytime soon.

This is what a monopoly is. Create your own market. Dominate it.

Competition eliminates profits and is bad for everyone in a market except the consumer. This entire reason is why capitalism is found everywhere in the world. The only way to get around it is to become a monopoly.

In short, ***competition is for losers, only monopolists win***.
